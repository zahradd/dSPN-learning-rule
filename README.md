**This is under construction**

## Overview

This repository contains the code and data used in the study **"Local, calcium- and reward-based synaptic learning rule that enhances dendritic nonlinearities can solve the nonlinear feature binding problem"** by **Zahra Khodadadi, Daniel Trpevski, Robert Lindroos, and Jeanette Hellgren Kotaleski**.

The study presents a **biophysically detailed model** of direct pathway Striatal Projection Neurons (dSPNs) and proposes two **synaptic learning rules**:

1. **A local synaptic learning rule** based on calcium dynamics and reward signals.
2. **An inhibitory plasticity rule** that enhances dendritic compartmentalization to improve feature discrimination.

The model demonstrates how a **single neuron can solve the Nonlinear Feature Binding Problem (NFBP)** by leveraging dendritic nonlinearities, metaplasticity, and inhibitory plasticity.

## Features

- **Multicompartmental dSPN Model:** Simulates dendritic plateau potentials and nonlinear synaptic integration.
- **Calcium-Based Synaptic Learning Rule:** Implements a biologically plausible LTP/LTD mechanism based on NMDA and L-type calcium channels.
- **Reward-Driven Synaptic Plasticity:** Uses dopamine signals to modify synaptic strengths dynamically.
- **Metaplasticity:** Regulates learning stability and maintains synaptic weights within a physiological range.
- **Inhibitory Plasticity Rule:** Enhances dendritic compartmentalization to improve feature discrimination.
- **Simulations for NFBP Learning:** Includes both clustered and randomly distributed synapses to test learning capabilities.
